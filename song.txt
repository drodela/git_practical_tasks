No Rain
Song by Blind Melon

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do
Is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view
But it's not sane
It's not sane
I just want someone to say to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll always be there when you wake, yeah, yeah
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today, hey
